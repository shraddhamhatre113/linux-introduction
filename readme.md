# LINUX OPERATING SYSTEAM
## History of linux
### what is linux?
&rarr; linux is a operating systeam

&rarr; free open source

&rarr; community

&rarr;Linux is like unix operating sytem that was design to provide personal computer.

&rarr;Linux has reputation as a very effiecient and fast performing system.

* ## History

&rarr; Developed as a project of linus torvaldas. student at univercity of Helsiniki.

&rarr; Based on small minix, small unix os.

&rarr;First release in 1991 with version 0.2.

&rarr; version 1.0 was released in 1994.

&rarr; current stable version is 2.6.24.

* ## Linux Kernel

&rarr;LINUX Kernel was developed by linus torvaldasat the university of Helsinki in finland.

&rarr; The Kernel Linux is not an Operating System 

&rarr; Linux is a kernel

&rarr; A kernel is a program that allocates and controls hardware resources in a system 

&rarr; Linux Distrobutions use the Linux kernel together with the GNU Operating System



&rarr; The Lin U x Kernel The Linuxkernel is currently maintained by

&rarr; Linus Torvalds and a few hundred other 

&rarr; Releases are ered in a very ordered fashion. 

* Major
* minor
* patchlevel Odd minor are kernels Thus 
* 2.4.20 latest stable kernel 
* 2.5.67 latest developrnent kernel 
will become the 2.6 kernel

* ## what is Unix?
&rarr; Unix is a portable, multitasking, multiuser, time-sharing operating system (OS) originally developed in 1969 by a group of employees at AT&T. 

&rarr; Unix was first programmed in assembly language but was reprogrammed in C in 1973.

&rarr; Unix has been ported to more machine families than any other operating system. 

&rarr; Unix developers espouse simplicity, portability and clarity in design. In order to adhere to this philosophy, Unix systems are characterized by:

&#42; The use of text files for data storage

&#42; A hierarchical file system

&#42; A large number of small programs, strung 
  together through a command-line interpreter

&#42; Use of shell scripts

&#42; The avoidance of captive user interfaces


* ## What is Shell?

&rarr; An interface between the Linux system and the user

&rarr; Used to call commands and programs
An interpreter

&rarr; Powerful programming language
“Shell scripts” = .bat .cmd EXEC REXX

&rarr; Many available (bsh; ksh; csh; bash; tcsh)

&rarr; A shell is any program that takes input from the user, translates it into instructions that the operating system can understand, and conveys the operating system's output back to the user. 

i.e. Any User Interface 
Character Based v Graphics Based 




* ## Linux Distribution

&rarr; Many private distribution

&rarr; Private

&rarr; usually specialize

&#42;  Firewall

&#42; Minimal install

&#42; Flopy disc linux

&#42; Language specified


* ## Linux OS Distribution

&rarr;  Linus Torvalds created Linux and distributed early versions across the Internet for the enjoyment of many hardcore hackers 

&rarr; Today, Linux is distributed in many ways, including CD-ROMs, tapes, Internet and even inside diskettes.
 
&rarr; A Linux distribution has the utilities and other programs in Unix.

&rarr; Linux OS Distributions (cont.) Linux is constantly evolving and hardware support is frequently updated 

&rarr; Not many hardware are compatible with Linux 

&rarr; But the compatibility of hardware has improved since Linux gain more 

* ##  Linux distribution list 

 &#42; There are a number of Linux distributions across the world 
 
 &#42; A few most popular distributions: 
 
 &#42; RedHat – The most popular Linux. Evolving fast with great GUI’s and other auto-detect facilities and tools. Latest version : RedHat 9.0 
 
 &#42; Slackware – The first Linux distribution created. Inherited from the real Linux from Linus Torvalds. Quite tedious to master but good for research purposes.urce software
 
  &#42; Mandrake – Competitors to RedHat. Has good GUI’s and good for servers. Easy to master and has many online help. 
  
  &#42; Lindows – It has most Linux and Windows 
  capabilities. Evolving fast to compete Microsoft Windows. The good news is : it is FREE –UnitedLinux 
  
  &#42; A combination of Slackware, SuSE and Caldera. Competitor for RedHat and big threat for Windows. 
  
  &#42; Other distributions such as : SuSE, Caldera, Debian, OpenLinux, FreeBSD, etc. CMPF112: Computing 

  * ## The OS

&rarr; The OS “Linux” refers to the kernel, the core of the OS 
 
&rarr; The kernel is what actually makes the computer run Developed under the GNU General Public License CMPF112: Computing Skills14 

* ## GNU General Public License 

&rarr; Sponsored by the Free Software Foundation 

&rarr; A method for a program author to provide the code yet protect it from becoming proprietary 

&rarr; Any program developed under this license can be changed at will 

&rarr; However, no money can be charged for the code itself, it must be freely available 

&rarr; Can charge for support, development and distribution costs CMPF112: Computing Skills15

* ## GNU & Linux Tools 

&rarr; GNU stands for “GNU’s Not Unix” 

&rarr; Richard Stallman created the foundation to help write free versions of the Unix software tools 

&rarr; Linux benefits from most of these tools, which is why often you’ll see GNU/Linux

* ## Advantages of Linux OS
### &rarr; Cost

&#42; Linux operating system comes with General Public License (GPL). 

&#42; Different from windows it does not require any licenses. 

### &rarr; Security

&#42; On default, Linux is designed to be secure. 

&#42; Unlike Windows, Linux is not much exposed to viruses. 

&#42; On very rare occasions, Linux is virus affected.

### &rarr; Source Code

&#42; Linux is an operating system which is of open source base. Which means that the code is free to modify.

### &rarr; System Requirements

&#42; Linux OS can even run on systems with low specifications. 

&#42; It is not very resource intensive like windows operating system. 

### &rarr; System Updates

&#42; Linux is also a step forward in terms of system updates. 

&#42; Frequently, the Linux OS releases system updates.

* ## Disadvatages of Linux
### &rarr; Adaption

&#42; For people who are less expertise in computers it can be hard to understand Linux. 

&#42; Most users find it difficult to adopt to Linux due to the terminals used. 

### &rarr; Software Compatibility
&#42; 
Popular applications which are made for Windows and Mac are not available for Linux. 

### &rarr; Gaming

&#42; Similar to sofwares, games too doesn't natively support Linux. 

&#42; Because Linux is not a platform which is not widely used, gaming developers are not much interested in Linux.

&#42;  So you cannot expect your favorite game to run on Linux. 

### &rarr; Hardware Compatibility
&#42; Almost all the hardwares can be connected to a Linux operating system. 

&#42; But the problem comes with the drivers. The concept of drivers in Linux is very different from other operating system.

### &rarr; Technical Support
&#42; Since Linux is an open source operating system it lacks on the side of technical support. 

&#42; The problem cannot be rectified unless you find a solution yourself.
